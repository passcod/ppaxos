# Decisions

This document records decisions made. Inspired by [this post][akazlou].
Here are a few guidelines as to how to use and append to this file:

- Record **why** that specific decision was made. Even if it was just personal
  taste or "I was told to do it" (in that case, ask whomever told you for their
  reasoning, or put their name in there). And yes, even if it was "this was the
  first option I tried."

- Record the **alternatives considered**. It is ok to state that no
  alternatives were considered at all. If you had alternatives that you didn't
  consider, record those as well (but separate them clearly).

- Record the **potential risks** you have foreseen could occur due to this
  decision. Risks could be from any aspect: cost, extensibility, maintenance,
  learning curve, or really anything else. This section is optional, but if you
  predicted there would be **no** risk, record _that_.

- **Never change anything**; only add new entries. If you change a prior
  decision, even if you were the one to do it, just record the new decision and
  document why you changed your mind. Keep the old entry there so the process
  and evolution remains visible.

Entries are dated YYYY-MM-DD and in reverse chronological order (newest first).
